normalization - efficient way of neatly organizing data
1NF
Every piece of information in a cell must be atomic (indivisible).
Don't store multiple values in a single cell.
There should be no repeating groups (no extra columns for similar data).
2NF
A table must first satisfy 1NF.
If there is a composite primary key (a key made up of more than one column), every other column in the table must 
depend on the entire primary key, not just part of it.
3NF
A table must first satisfy 2NF.
No non-key column should depend on another non-key column. Every non-key column must depend only on the primary key.
