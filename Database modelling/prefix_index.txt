A prefix column refers to indexing only the first part (or prefix) of a string column rather than the entire value. 
It is a technique used to create partial indexes on long string columns to save space and improve query performance.
CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column_name(N));
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE Email LIKE 'john.doe%';
Limitations of Prefix Index
Not Suitable for Full Matches:
Uniqueness Constraint:
show indexes in table_name; 

Duplicate Indexes: Same index on the same column(s) multiple times.
Redundant Indexes: Indexes that duplicate the functionality of existing indexes, offering no 
additional performance benefit.
Both types waste space, increase maintenance overhead, and can reduce performance
