Transactions
they are like checkpoints to go back to if anything wrong happens
A transaction is a group of tasks or operations performed on a database that are
 treated as a single unit. It ensures that either all the operations succeed or none of them happen.
 It follows acid properties
 atomicity-all or nothing
 consistency-consistent throughout the states
 isolation- changes musnt affect any other tables
 durability- data loss shouldnt happen even if power failure

 START TRANSACTION;

-- Deduct ₹500 from Account A
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 500
WHERE account_id = 1;

-- Add ₹500 to Account B
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 500
WHERE account_id = 2;

-- Commit the changes (if no errors)
COMMIT;
--------------
ROLLBACK; -- Undo all changes made in the transaction

Rollback works by undoing all changes made during a transaction that have not yet been committed
you cannot rollback after a commit in SQL.
