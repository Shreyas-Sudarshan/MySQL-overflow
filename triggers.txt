triggers are a set of actions that happen by itslef on certain instructions .
before after    insert update delete   
new and old keywords
In MySQL, NEW and OLD are special keywords used in triggers to refer to the values of columns before and after 
a database operation (like INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE). They allow you to access or manipulate data during these
 operations.
CREATE TRIGGER after_user_insert
AFTER INSERT ON Users
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO UserLogs (action)
    VALUES (CONCAT('User ', NEW.username, ' added'));
END;

SHOW TRIGGERS;
DROP TRIGGER trigger_name;
DISABLE TRIGGER trigger_name ON table_name;
ENABLE TRIGGER trigger_name ON table_name;
we cannot directly alter triggers in sql. drop the old one and create a new one.
